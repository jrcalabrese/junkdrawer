I haven't actually started this project yet, but if I put it here, it'll remind me that I should start working on it soon. 

## Project description 

I have a running list of things that other people have told me cannot be done in R, so either I'll figure out how they can be done in R with existing packages or write functions for them.

* A very-easy simple slopes graph maker like [Curran-Bauer's website](http://www.quantpsy.org/interact/) that is compatible with `ggplot2`
* A Venn Diagram maker based on partial and semipartial correlation values
* Extract partial/semipartial correlations out of an existing linear model object in R
* Fisher r-to-z transformation calculator
